Boil a kettle full of water
Immediately, add one teaspoon of salt
When the water starting bubbling, put the pasta in (250g per person)
On the back of the packet, it will say how long to boil the pasta for.
Once the timer is over, try to make sure itâ€™s al dente (Not to soft, but not hard)  
Afterwards, drain half the pan of water
Leave the pasta to cool down LID OFF
Carefully, add some pasta sauce to give some flavour
If required, great some cheese on the pasta.
